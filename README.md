# sudoku_solver
WIP

Mainly tested on 4x4 not 9x9.

can generate one solution if number of givens is >= minimum, or will generate multiple solution if < minimum.

Now functional for 4x4 but too slow for 9x9 (don't even try 16x16 or greater).

on 4x4 if can test ~100,000 possibilies in a couple of seconds I think.
